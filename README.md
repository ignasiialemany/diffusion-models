## Installation

It is recommended to use a virtual environment for Python, such as Anaconda. First, install the external packages via `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then, install the code in this repository using `pip install -e .`. The `-e` flag only adds the package path to Python and leaves the source files editable.
